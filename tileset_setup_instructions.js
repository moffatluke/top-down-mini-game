TILESET SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==========================

1. Save your uploaded tileset image as "overworld_tileset.png" in the assets/sprites/ folder

2. The tileset will be automatically loaded and processed by the TilesetExtractor

3. Open tileset_debug.html in your browser to identify tile coordinates

4. Update the tile coordinates in SpriteLoader.js extractCommonTiles() method based on your actual tileset

Current estimated coordinates (you'll need to adjust these):
- Grass tiles: Look for green grass patches, usually in top rows
- Stone/cobblestone: Look for gray stone textures  
- Water: Look for blue water tiles
- Tree: Look for tree sprites
- House parts: Look for building/structure tiles
- Dirt: Look for brown soil tiles

5. To test the tileset system:
   - Go to the main room in the game
   - Head to the east exit (right side) to enter the "tileset_demo" room
   - You should see a test area with various tile types

6. Debugging tips:
   - Check browser console for tileset loading messages
   - Use the tileset_debug.html file to identify exact coordinates
   - Adjust the tile coordinates in extractCommonTiles() method
   - Reload the game to see changes

Example tile coordinate updates:
```javascript
const tileMap = {
    'tileset_grass': { x: 0, y: 0 },     // Adjust based on your tileset
    'tileset_dirt': { x: 1, y: 0 },      // Brown dirt tile location
    'tileset_stone': { x: 2, y: 0 },     // Stone tile location  
    'tileset_water': { x: 0, y: 1 },     // Water tile location
    'tileset_tree': { x: 3, y: 0 },      // Tree tile location
    // Add more as needed...
};
```

The system is designed to:
- Extract 16x16 tiles from your sprite sheet
- Scale them up to 48x48 for the game
- Cache extracted tiles for performance
- Fallback to original sprites if tileset fails

Happy mapping!
